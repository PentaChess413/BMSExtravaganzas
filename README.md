# What's this?
Various scripts for Luigi Auriemma's amazing QuickBMS tool I made and/or ported from someone else's standalone tool (always check the code to see the credits).
# My setup
Linux Mint with VSCodium. ClaudeAI, ChatGPT and DeepWiki occassionally used.
# Why not Total Commander?
Because I'm nowhere near knowledgeable enough of the API to try that. Still, a little known fact
# License
The scripts should eventually be sorted in folders by license. As a general rule, if one was posted unlicensed, I'll put it under unclear license pending further clarification.   
The default license will be the GNU GPL v3.0, because proprietary mod tools is not something me or most programmers like dealing with (Linux problems, slower progress, lost knowledge...)
